ELEN 423 Homework 5
I'm a senior in Electrical Engineering, and I really enjoy the labs where I get to build practical devices, like an FM transmitter and audio amplifier. I'm a certified SCUBA diver and have been diving in the Caribbean. In addition to diving I'm also a bit of a car nut, I drive a sedan with a V8 engine and find the open road to be very relaxing, especially at night.
